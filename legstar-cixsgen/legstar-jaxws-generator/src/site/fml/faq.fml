       Why am I getting a "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServletContextListener" 
       when starting Tomcat after I deployed my JAX-WS endpoint?
      </question>
      <answer>
       You probably did not install a JAX-WS runtime in Tomcat. In order to do so, you must download a JAX-WS 2.1
       implementation such as <a href="https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/ri-download.html">Sun's JAX-WS RI</a> and copy the jar files
       into a common location such as shared/lib under Tomcat.

       Why am I getting a "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/legstar/host/invoke/HostInvokeException" 
       when starting Tomcat after I deployed my JAX-WS endpoint?
      </question>
      <answer>
       The default war file created by the ant script does not include the LegStar binaries. To fix this 
       issue, copy all legstar-*.jar files from the installDir/lib folder into a common location such as
       shared/lib under Tomcat.

       Why am I getting a "org.apache.commons.configuration.ConfigurationException: Cannot locate configuration source
       legstar-invoker-config.xml" when starting running my JAX-WS endpoint?
      </question>
      <answer>
       The endpoint implementation is looking for a configuration file which name is specified in the web.xml
       deployment file. By default this file is named legstar-invoker-config.xml. There is a sample of such a 
       file in the samples folder of the distribution. You need to customize this file and make a copy in the
       shared/classes folder under Tomcat.

      <question>
       I have successfully deployed the sample JAX-WS endpoint. How do I test it?
      </question>
      <answer>
       You can direct your browser to a URL such as "http://localhost:8080/cixs-lsfileae/lsfileae?wsdl",
       assuming your Server runs locally and is listening on port 8080.
