<configuration>
  <!-- There must be a maximum of 1 engine elements -->
  <engine>
    <!-- Maximum number of waiting requests. When this number is reached, the
         engine will stop accepting requests. If the host system is
         unresponsive it is not useful to continue to accept requests.  -->

         to become available.  -->

      <!-- Choose between a JNDI implemented work manager or the default
           one. The engine will first look at the JNDI so comment out
           the JNDILocation element if you would like the default
           work manager to be used.  -->

             reusable threads. The engine itself uses one of the
             threads, then there is one thread per active host
             connection. This number must be larger than the sum of
             all pool sizes (defined in hostEndPoints) plus one.  -->
