COBOL Transformers API (coxbapi) overview

  COBOL Trransformers are used to convert raw mainframe data to java objects, XML or JSON.
  
  They are also used to convert java objects, XML or JSON back to mainframe data.
  
  This is the layer that shields COBOL Transformers code from the actual runtime implementation.
  
  The programming model is based on the visitor pattern.
