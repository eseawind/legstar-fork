JAXB COBOL Annotator (jaxbgen) overview

  This module translates COBOL-annotated XML schemas to COBOL-annotated Java classes.
  
  COBOL-annotated XML schemas are typically produced by other legstar modules.   
  
  This is based on JAXB. It is primarily implemented as a JAXB plugin and propagates 
  the COBOL annotations from the XML schemas into java 1.5 annotations within
  the JAXB classes.
