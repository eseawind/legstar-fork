PREREQUISITES:

 LegStar Mainframe Proxy runtime (C2wsrt) requires a Servlet engine such
 as {{{http://tomcat.apache.org/}Apache Tomcat}}.
  
 LegStar C2wsrt uses JAX-WS as client SOAP stack to invoke target Web Services.
 C2wsrt should work with any JAX-WS 2.1 compliant implementation. The Sun's JAX-WS
 reference implementation is shipped with LegStar.
 
 LegStar C2wsrt uses classes produced by the {{{http://www.legsem.com/legstar/legstar-core/legstar-coxbgen/index.html}COBOL
 Binding Generator}} for marshaling/unmarshaling mainframe data. 
  
 On the host side, you can use CICS default HTTP APIs which are EXEC CICS WEB
 for CICS TS 3.1+ and DFHWBCLI for older versions. Alternatively, C2wsrt comes
 with a simple HTTP client API for CICS. The {{{./LSHTTAPI-readme.html}
 LSHTTAPI readme}} document describes the program and how to install it.
 
 The LegStar CICS programs are written in C370 and require Language
 Environment (LE).

 Java 1.5+ and ANT 1.6.5+ are both prerequisites for LegStar.
 Make sure JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME environment variables are set and that
 $JAVA_HOME/bin (%JAVA_HOME%/bin on Windows) and $ANT_HOME/bin (%ANT_HOME%/bin on Windows)
 are both in your system path.
 
INSTALLING/UNINSTALLING:

 These instructions apply if you are installing from the C2wsrt standalone
 distribution. If you are installing the complete LegStar distribution please
 refer to {{{http://www.legsem.com/legstar/legstar-distribution/install-instructions.html}legstar distribution}}.

 [[1]] Unzip the binary distribution package into the directory of your choice,
       referred to as <installDir> in the following steps.

   The directory tree should look like this:
   
+---------------------------------------+

 [[2]] Install the mainframe C370 programs.
 
 This is needed only if you intend to use the LegStar HTTP client API for
 CICS.
 
 We encourage you to use the common distribution of all LegStar z/OS modules.
 Instructions on how to install are available
 {{{../legstar-distribution-zos/install-instructions.html}here}}.
       
 If you decide to install the CICS programs from sources, they are available
 from the zos folder.
 
 The JCLs used by LegStar to compile and link-edit these sources are
 available from {{{../legstar-distribution-zos}here}}.
 
 Finally each module has some documentation under zos/docs.
       
 [[3]] You will need to copy the jar files from the <lib> folder to 
       a location such as <CATALINA_BASE>/shared/lib.
   
 [[4]] Refer to {{{http://www.legsem.com/legstar/legstar-cixsgen/legstar-jaxws_generator}Service Generator}} to generate COBOL
       sample code as well as servlets which are needed to invoke a Web Service
       or a POJO from the mainframe.
       
 [[5]] To uninstall, remove the installDir folder.
