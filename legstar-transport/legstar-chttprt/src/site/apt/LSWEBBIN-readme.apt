 CICS Server for HTTP

CICS Web-aware program LSWEBBIN

* Overview:

 This C/370 program can be used to remotely link to a CICS program over 
 HTTP or HTTPS. LSWEBBIN uses the CICS Web Support capability introduced
 by IBM in CICS TS 1.3.

 Clients using LSWEBBIN are expected to send binary data in the
 HTTP payload. The client is responsible for formatting the data according
 to the target CICS program expectations. LSWEBBIN does not perform any
 translation over the data. This means it is the client responsibility to
 perform such conversions as Ascii to Ebcdic, host numeric encoding, etc.
 LSWEBBIN has a very minimal footprint on the mainframe.

 LSWEBBIN relies on specialized libraries, delivered as C370 programs
 to provide messaging, tracing and CICS link functionalities to both
 COMMAREA and CONTAINERS driven programs.

* Limitations:

  - LSWEBBIN does not support the INPUTMSG option of the LINK command.
 
* This program has been tested for:

  - CICS TS 2.3 (6.3.0 Command language translator) and TS 3.1 (6.4.0)
 
  - C/370 for OS/390 V2 R10

* How to use:

 Once LSWEBBIN is compiled in a library available to your CICS
 region in the RPL list, you might need to define it using RDO
 (unless programs get autoinstalled).

 First time around, you can point your browser to a URL with the 
 following form: http://host:port/CICS/CWBA/LSWEBBIN. You should
 receive a greeting reply. Note that the form of the URL can be
 customized by your CICS administrator, therefore you might want
 to check with him.

 LSWEBBIN serves clients using the{{{../legstar-chttprt/index.html}LegStar
 chttprt library}}. This library formats the http payload as
 compact binary. LSWEBBIN expects the following standard HTTP headers:

*--------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------+
| HTTP method  | Mandatory | Should be POST for a client program.             |
*--------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Content-Type | Mandatory | Should contain "application/octet-stream".       |
*--------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------+
Standard HTTP Headers

 In addition, these optional extension headers can be specified:

*------------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------+
| CICSTraceMode    | Optional  | Turns traces on in CICS if value is 'true'.  |
*------------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------+
| CICSRequestID    | Optional  | Correlates the traces produced in CICS with  |
|                  |           | the client request.                          |
*------------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------+
HTTP Extension headers

 Upon reply, any error will be signaled back with HTTP status code 500,
 Internal Server error. If the error was trapped by LSWEBBIN, further error
 description can be found in the CICSError HTTP header.
 
 Be advised that in case of an error, the reply payload will actually be
 translated to ISO-8859-1.

 Errors trapped by LSWEBBIN are also logged into CICS CESE TD Queue which
 usually points to CEEMSG.

 If no errors occured, the reply data will be binary and signaled with a
 content-type of "application/octet-stream".
