PREREQUISITES:

 Csokrt requires a version of CICS that has IBM CICS Sockets installed.
 CICS Sockets are not installed by default in a CICS region. In order to
 check if your region has Sockets installed try transaction EZAC or EZAO.
 If these transactions are not installed, you need to follow instructions
 in the IBM "IP CICS Sockets Guide" manual.
 
 LSSOKBIN was not tested under DOS/VSE although it might work with the CSI
 stack.
 
 The LegStar CICS programs are written in C370 and require Language
 Environment (LE).
 
 Before Csokrt can be used, the mainframe side C370 programs must be installed.
 The easiest way to do that is to use the common distribution of all
 LegStar z/OS modules, available {{{../legstar-distribution-zos/index.html}here}}.
 
 The main C370 program for Csokrt is {{{./LSSOKBIN-readme.html}LSSOKBIN, the CICS
 Server for Sockets}}. This program uses the following libraries:

 * {{{../legstar-invoker/LSLNKBIN-readme.html}LSLNKBIN CICS LINK library}}

 * {{{../legstar-invoker/LSLNKCOM-readme.html}LSLNKCOM CICS COMMAREA LINK library}}

 * {{{../legstar-invoker/LSLNKCTN-readme.html}LSLNKCTN CICS CONTAINERS LINK library}}

 * {{{../legstar-messaging/LSCOMLOG-readme.html}LSCOMLOG Tracing and logging library}}

 Java 1.5+ and ANT 1.6.5+ are both prerequisites for LegStar.
 Make sure JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME environment variables are set and that
 $JAVA_HOME/bin (%JAVA_HOME%/bin on Windows) and $ANT_HOME/bin (%ANT_HOME%/bin on Windows)
 are both in your system path.
 
INSTALLING/UNINSTALLING:

 These instructions apply if you are installing from the Csokrt standalone
 distribution. If you are installing the complete LegStar distribution please
 refer to {{{http://www.legsem.com/legstar/legstar-distribution/install-instructions.html}legstar distribution}}.

 [[1]] Unzip the binary distribution package into the directory of your choice,
       referred to as <installDir> in the following steps.

   The directory tree should look like this:

+---------------------------------------+
   
 [[2]] Install the mainframe C370 programs.
 
 We encourage you to use the common distribution of all LegStar z/OS modules.
 Instructions on how to install are available
 {{{../legstar-distribution-zos/install-instructions.html}here}}.
       
 If you decide to install the CICS programs from sources, they are available
 from the zos folder.
 
 The JCLs used by LegStar to compile and link-edit these sources are
 available from {{{../legstar-distribution-zos}here}}.
 
 Finally each module has some documentation under zos/docs.
       
 [[3]] To uninstall, remove the installDir folder and remove mainframe libraries.

CONFIGURING AND RUNNING THE SAMPLE:

 [[1]]  Setup a CICS IP Listener:
 
 In addition to CICS Sockets being installed, at least one IBM Enhanced CICS
 Socket listener must be running and assigned to LSSOKBIN. Use the IBM EZAC
 transaction to define a new one. When you create the listener, you must select
 the ENHANCED version rather than the STANDARD one and specify the transaction
 name you wish to associate to LSSOKBIN.
        
 This is a typical setting for an Enhanced Listener as needed for Csokrt:

+-------------------------------+
 EZAC,DISplay,LISTENER (enhanced listener)                    APPLID = CICS     
                                                                                
 APPLID       ===> CICS                 APPLID of CICS System                   
 TRANID       ===> CSKM                 Transaction Name of Listener            
 PORT         ===> 03012                Port Number of Listener

 NUMSOCK      ===> 050                  Number of Sockets in Listener           
 ACCTIME      ===> 030                  Timeout Value for ACCEPT                
 GIVTIME      ===> 030                  Timeout Value for GIVESOCKET            
 REATIME      ===> 030                  Timeout Value for READ

 WLM groups   ===> WLMGRP04     ===> WLMGRP05     ===> WLMGRP06                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
 PF 1               3 END           6               9               12 CNCL     
+-------------------------------+

  You can telnet to the CICS Sockets IP address and port number to make sure
  they are accessible.

 [[2]] Setup security:

 Clients are expected to send USER/PASSWORD combinations as part of the
 Connection Initial Message received by the IBM CICS Sockets Listener.
 A sample program, EZACICSE.CBL written in COBOL is provided to perform
 a simple security check on the credentials provided. The security exit
 will also pass the USER back to the IBM Listener so that it could start
 the server transaction under this particular USER authority (impersonation).
   
 USER/PASSWORD are sent in clear text between the client and the IBM
 CICS Listener. Starting with z/OS 1.7, SSL is supported for CICS Sockets
 but this has not been tested yet and is likely to require changes on
 the client side.
 
 [[3]] Setup the invoker configuration:
 
 The Socket Transport expects a configuration file such as the
 {{{./samples/legstar-invoker-config.xml}legstar-invoker-config.xml}} sample
 provided.
  
 The hostConnectionFactory element in the configuration file must be:
  
+-------------------------------+
	<hostConnectionfactoryClass>com.legstar.csok.client.CicsSocketConnectionFactory</hostConnectionfactoryClass>
+-------------------------------+
  
  The relevant endpoint elements for the Socket Transport in the configuration file are:
  
*-----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| hostIPAddress   | Mandatory |CICS TCPIP address                                                  |
*-----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| hostIPPort      | Mandatory | CICS Sockets listening TCPIP port                                  |
*-----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| hostCharset     | Optional  |A valid character set such as IBM01140                              |
*-----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| hostUserID      | Optional  | A CICS user ID                                                     |
*-----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| hostPassword    | Optional  | A CICS password                                                    |
*-----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
 
  Parameters marked as optional must be provided as part of the request Address if they 
  are not provided in the configuration file.
  
 
 [[4]] Run the sample provided:
 
 Type ant in the samples/quickstarts/csokrt folder, this should compile and run the test.
 Check the output of the ant script.
